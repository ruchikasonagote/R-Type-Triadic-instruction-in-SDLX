# R-Type-Triadic-instruction-in-SDLX
This file has verilog code for R Type Triadic instruction of SDLX processor which can be implementated on FPGA (basys3). It can perform basic operations in the ALU file such as addition, subtraction, shift left or right, etc. Registers required for isntructions can be found in register file with 32 registers.
# Steps 
1. Create a project file in Vivado.
2. Create the three files named - 'R_triadic.v', 'Reg_File.v', 'ALU.v' inside the project file.
3. Add the testbench file to see the output.
4. Save and run synsthesis.
5. Create the constraints file.
6. Save and run to see the output on FPGA.
